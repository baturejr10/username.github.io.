			<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Ahmad Barue Ado, and I am a rising junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at Nile university of Abuja. I've always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm particularly drawn to the potential of AI to revolutionize various industries. I've excelled academically, maintaining a 3.8 GPA, and I've actively sought opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through extracurricular activities. I'm a member of the university's Computer Science Club, where I contribute to coding workshops and participate in hackathons. I also volunteer at the local community center, where I help students with their coding projects. My goal is to contribute to the development of ethical and innovative AI solutions that benefit society, and I am excited to continue my journey of learning and growth here at the university
